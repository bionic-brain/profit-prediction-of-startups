In this project, I focused on selecting the optimal linear regression model to predict a target variable Profit based on the features: R&D spend, Administration Cost and Marketing spend.
By leveraging advanced preprocessing techniques and incorporating statistical validation, I evaluated multiple models, including Ridge and Lasso regression, and conducted hyperparameter tuning using both manual and GridSearchCV methods.
My findings showcase the effectiveness of regularization in improving predictive accuracy and robustness, particularly for this small dataset.
Visualizations such as bar plots and scatter plots enhance the interpretability of results.
